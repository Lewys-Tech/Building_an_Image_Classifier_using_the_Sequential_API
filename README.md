Built with Tensorflow and Keras

NOTE: If you are not satisfied with the performance of your model, you should go back and
tune the hyperparameters. The first one to check is the learning rate. If that doesnâ€™t
 help, try another optimizer (and always retune the learning rate after changing any
 hyperparameter). If the performance is still not great, then try tuning model hyper
parameters such as the number of layers, the number of neurons per layer, and the
 types of activation functions to use for each hidden layer.
