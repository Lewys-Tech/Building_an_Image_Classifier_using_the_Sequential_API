Overview

This project implements a neural network to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset, a drop-in replacement for the classic MNIST dataset. Fashion MNIST consists of 70,000 grayscale images (28 × 28 pixels each) across 10 classes of fashion items, such as clothing and accessories. Unlike MNIST (handwritten digits), Fashion MNIST is more challenging due to the diversity within each class, with a simple linear model achieving ~83% accuracy compared to ~92% on MNIST.




NOTE: If you are not satisfied with the performance of your model, you should go back and
tune the hyperparameters. The first one to check is the learning rate. If that doesn’t
 help, try another optimizer (and always retune the learning rate after changing any
 hyperparameter). If the performance is still not great, then try tuning model hyper
parameters such as the number of layers, the number of neurons per layer, and the
 types of activation functions to use for each hidden layer.
